## What it does
This script works on modelling hospital emergency department demand data with weather data as predictor.

Data used is from
-  Emergency departments admissions and attendance dataset provided by the Department of Health of Western Australia
- daily temperature and precipitation data from the NOAA api

## Purpose

The model could be used by hospital staffing departments to efficiently plan duty rosters and prevent a 
mismatch between patient demand for emergency services and availability of staff.
